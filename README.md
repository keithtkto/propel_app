Technologies Utilized

A variety of languages, frameworks, libraries, and other technologies were used to create Propel. 

HTML: Used to create page elements

CSS: Used to style page elements
    Twitter Bootstrap: a framework for creating responsive and organized page layouts

Javascript: Used for DOM manipulation, authentication, routing, controlling, and most dynamic page actions, among other functions
    jQuery: framework useful for easing the task of manipulating the DOM
    SocketIO: framework that enables real-time rendering for multiple viewers
    Ajax: asynchronous real-time rendering, among other capabilities
    MEN Stack:
        MongoDB: non-relational database system on which all user and classroom data is stored and organized. Mongoose was used as an intermediary for manipulating databases
        Express.js: Server framework for node.js
        Node.js: Runtime environment for the application
    
In addition, LinkedIn's OAuth was used to sign up and authenticate users of Propel.

Other Technologies: Sublime Text (composition), Git (version control), Bootply (views testing), Heroku (deployment), among others.

General Approach for Assembly

Our team took advantage of the AGILE approach to development. AGILE encourages developers to envision project features in terms of the needs of site users. To this end, we generated numerous "user stories": what users would want to do or see on the site, and why.

We then generated static visuals to begin realizing our user stories. These included wireframes, or diagrams, of site views. Concurrently, we developed a "pitch deck" that expressed our developing vision for Propel in terms of a business proposition to be pitched to investors.

Development then proceeded along two parallel paths: front-end web design beside back-end functionality. Once front-end views were templated, they were converted into embedded javascript files, a requirement for making our website a dynamic entity. At the same time, a great deal of applied logic went into creating seed data, routes, controller actions, and other computational structures.

Gradually these two halves came together to form a site we very much hope you enjoy.

Technologies Propel Utilizes

A variety of languages, frameworks, libraries, and other technologies were used to create Propel.

CSS: Used to style page elements

Javascript: Used for DOM manipulation, authentication, routing, controlling, and most dynamic page actions, among other functions
    jQuery: framework useful for easing the task of manipulating the DOM
    SocketIO: framework that enables real-time rendering for multiple viewers
    Ajax: asynchronous real-time rendering, among other capabilities
    MEN Stack:
        MongoDB: non-relational database system on which all user and classroom data is stored and organized. Mongoose was used as an intermediary for manipulating databases
        Express.js: Server framework for node.js
        Node.js: Runtime environment for the application
    
Other Technologies: Sublime Text (composition), Git (version control), Bootply (views testing), Heroku (deployment), among others
